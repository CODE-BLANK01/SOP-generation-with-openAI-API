Hello Everyone,

I have provided the zip file of the project i was assigned as the interview assessment, I have customised the UI based on the website of your campany so that if you are considering to integrate it with your website it won't require much modifications.

Steps to execute the asessment:
1. extract the zip file 
2. open it any IDE, i am using vs code for demonstration 
3. download the node.js from the browser
4. open the terminal in vs code and give in the command "npm install" and wait for it to install all the dependancies.
5. after the installation give one more command "nodemon app.js" so that server is started and is available on "http://localhost:3000/generate-sop"
6. Try the web app  for yourself but dont forget to configure the fake smtp auth credentials to see the mail being generated.

NOTE: As i did not have any smtp server i have used fake smtp server to demonstrate the functioning, it won't take much modification to implement it with actual smtp server.
